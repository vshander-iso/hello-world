# hello-world
This project is a recommended GitHub exercise.
I am taking a coursera class (Data Scientist's Toolbox) from Johns Hopkins.
## Notes on (notes)

* In fact, one can simply work in master, doing commits there, and  never create any branches.
* It is easy to align local and GitHub repos, at least when you are the owner, after linking local repo and GitHub. I am not sure yet, but it's likely that only committed changes are passed back and forth.
* However, I had to "add" first (even though the file was pulled from gitHub), only then commit and then push.
* The control, so far, came from the local repo.
**push sends from local to GitHub
**pull updates the local to match GitHub
